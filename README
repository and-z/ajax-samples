This fork aimed to reimplement the original functionality using the Thymeleaf templating engine and its extension Dialects.

Unfortunately it is not possible to simple run JSP based views beside the Thymeleaf based ones due to ViewResolver chaining issue (see http://forum.thymeleaf.org/Chaining-view-resolvers-td3295026.html).
So I will not remove the original JSP and Java files, so they can be easily compared to the Thymeleaf related files.
However both view technologies could be combined using Apache Tiles and the appropriate Thymeleaf extension (https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-extras-tiles2).

Before installing those samples please make sure that Maven and git have been installed and configured properly on your local system.
